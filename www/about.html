    <h2>GTagHD</h2>
    <h3>Iowa State/Mayo Clinic Alliance for Genome Engineering</h3>
    <p>Homology directed gene targeting allows for the integration of exogenous DNA into the genome with base pair and reading frame specificity. However, design and assembly of homologous targeting vectors for a gene of interest can be time consuming.</p>
    <p>Our modular plasmid series, pGTag, and homology design web tool, GTagHD, enable researchers to quickly design, build, and integrate a variety of cargos into a gene of interest. Golden Gate cloning of annealed oligonucleotide homology arms allows efficient, inexpensive vector assembly.</p>
    <p>Follow the prompts under the “Submit Single Job” tab to have GTagHD design and output ready-to-order ssDNA oligonucleotides to be used in our GTag series gene targeting protocol.</p>

      <figcaption>Upon CRISPR/Cas9 targeting of both the genome and plasmid donors, we hypothesize that DNA end resection mediated by the MRN complex and ExoI results in annealing of complementary homology arms. Homology dependent repair pathways drive seamless, homology directed integration of cargo DNA into the CRISPR/Cas9 DNA Double-Strand Break site.</figcaption>
